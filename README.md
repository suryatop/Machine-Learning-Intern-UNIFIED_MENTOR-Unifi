🐾 Animal Image Classifier
A deep learning-based image classification system that identifies 15 different animals using VGG16 and transfer learning. The project includes:
✅ Model Training using TensorFlow & Keras
✅ Streamlit Web App for real-time image classification
✅ Pretrained VGG16 for feature extraction

📌 Project Overview
This project classifies animal images into one of 15 categories using a convolutional neural network (CNN). A pretrained VGG16 model is used as a feature extractor, with a custom classifier trained on top of it.

🚀 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/animal-classifier.git
cd animal-classifier
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tensorflow streamlit tqdm numpy pillow
🎯 Model Training
Run the following command to train the model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
This will:
✅ Load & preprocess the dataset
✅ Use VGG16 for feature extraction
✅ Train a custom classifier
✅ Save the model as animal_classifier.h5

🌍 Run the Web App
After training, start the Streamlit web app:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
